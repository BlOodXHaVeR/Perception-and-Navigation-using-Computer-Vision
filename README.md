In this project we have built a neural network model that predicts the steering angle of a car
in the Udacity upen source self-driving car simulator by capturing images frames of the road 
along with the car steering angle when the frame is captured.

The data sets for training and testing are created by driving the car in the simulation track in the simulator



 model.h5 is the file for the convolutional neural network model created in Google Colab
 drive.py is used for connecting the neural network model to the udacity simulator.
